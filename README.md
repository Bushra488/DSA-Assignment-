# DSA-Assignment-
Binary Search and Linear Search
The purpose of this project is to implement Binary Search and Linear Search, two fundamental algorithms in computer science, and demonstrate their usage, efficiency, and time complexity.

How to Run the Program

Prerequisites

Python installed on your system (version 3.6 or above).

Steps

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-link>

Navigate to the project directory:

cd binary-linear-search

Run the program:

python search_algorithms.py

Follow the prompts in the program to see the results.

Purpose of the Code

Linear Search: Demonstrates a straightforward approach to find an element by iterating through the list.

Binary Search: Implements an efficient search for sorted data by dividing the search range in half repeatedly.

Highlights the efficiency of algorithms under different conditions, including edge cases.

Time Complexity

Binary Search

Average Case: 

Worst Case:  when the input data is unsorted. In such cases, Binary Search degenerates to inefficient behavior.

Linear Search

Average Case: 

Worst Case: , as it needs to scan the entire list.

Worst-Case Example for Binary Search

The program includes a demonstration where Binary Search fails on unsorted data, showing the importance of input conditions. 
Conclusion

This project demonstrates:

The implementation and efficiency of Linear and Binary Search algorithms.

The significance of input conditions (e.g., sorted data) for algorithm performance.

How to write clean, modular, and testable code.
